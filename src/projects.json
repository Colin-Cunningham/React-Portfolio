      "description": "One of my first ever projects, which combined JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The simple design is made to match the simplicity of the app. Just check boxes to select parameters and hit random. This will generate a fully random password, that can be easily copied to your clipboard. Great for creating a secure password, and just random combinations in general."

Although it may be a simple app, it demonstrates my ability to interact with API's and display data dynamically on the page."
